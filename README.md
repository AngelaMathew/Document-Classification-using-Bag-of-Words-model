# Document-Classification-using-Bag-of-Words-model

Document Classification is the task of assigning documents (images, texts, music etc) to one or more categories or classes.
Each class of documents possesses its special classification problems.
Classification may be done according to their subjects or other attributes like document type, year, theme etc.

The process can be automated using machine learning techniques like supervised(classification is based on some feedback or any trained model), unsupervised( classification is done without any external information), semisupervised( where parts of the document are labelled by an external mechanism) machine learning algorithms.

Techniques used for document classification include:
(EM)Expectation Maximization, 
Naive Bayes Classifier,
Latent Semantic Indexing,
Support Vector Machines,
Artificial Neural Network,
Decision Trees.

Applications:
Email spam filtering,
Email routing,
sentiment Analysis,
Language identification.

Here, we are focusing on text document classification using supervised machine learning techique.
